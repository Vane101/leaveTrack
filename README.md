Employee work leave application 

This is a simple spring-web-flow application that allows an employee to request work leave from his supervisor. 
At the moment the application has the following features:
•	A new employee can be created
•	 Employee can change his/her password
•	 Employee can edit his/her information
•	 Employee can request work leave
•	Supervisor can process logged request.
When an employee requests leave, an email is sent to his/her supervisor informing the individual that an employee has requested leave, the supervisor then logs into leaveTrack and processes all requests logged by his employees. 
Attached is an SQL file for creating the needed database and tables for this application. 
You can log into the application with: username:VZULU, password:vane
